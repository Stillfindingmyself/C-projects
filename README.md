Welcome to my collection of C language projects!  
This repo contains everything from beginner basics to more advanced builds — all coded with love, logic, and a bit of chaos.

## 🔥 Why This Exists
I’m learning C from scratch and using this space to drop my coolest and cleanest code. Each project here is either:
- A practice task
- A personal challenge
- Or just something I made because... why not?

## 📁 What You’ll Find
- ✅ Console-based programs  
- ✅ Beginner to intermediate projects  
- ✅ Clean formatting & comments  
- ✅ My journey in C, one `.c` file at a time

Just a student exploring the beauty of programming.  
Still finding myself... but at least I found `#include <stdio.h>`...
